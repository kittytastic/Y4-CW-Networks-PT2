We can dive a little deeper into comparing Nearness Centrality with Closeness Centrality and adjacency centrality with degree centrality by preforming a simple Spearman rank correlation analysis.
We can work out the rank of each node under a particular centrality metric by ordering the nodes by that metric.
Then preform Spearman rank corelation between the rank of nodes under 2 centrality metrics.
The correlation coefficient for Nearness and Closeness centrality, and for Degree and Adjacency Centrality are tabulated below. 
As a reminder, a coefficient of 1 means they are highly positively correlated and a coefficient of 0 means they have no corelation.

Using the corelation coefficient and observing the top 20 results for each dataset.
We can say that nearness centrality is a good alternative for closeness centrality.
Also we can say that adjacency centrality can be used as an alternative to degree centrality, although their relationship is less strong than that of nearness and closeness.
